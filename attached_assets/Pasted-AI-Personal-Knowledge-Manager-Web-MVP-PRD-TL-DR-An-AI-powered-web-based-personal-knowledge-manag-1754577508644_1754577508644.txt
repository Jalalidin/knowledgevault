AI Personal Knowledge Manager (Web MVP) PRD

TL;DR

An AI-powered web-based personal knowledge manager designed for students and professionals. The product automatically organizes pasted or uploaded materials—including text, images, audio, video, documents, and web links—into a secure, searchable, and encrypted knowledge base. Users can retrieve information via natural language queries, tags, and (optionally) voice search, with a focus on ease of use, privacy, and efficient information management.

Narrative

Maria is a graduate student juggling multiple research projects, lecture notes, and reference materials scattered across her laptop, email, and cloud drives. She often wastes precious time searching for a specific quote, image, or document she vaguely remembers saving weeks ago. Frustrated by the chaos and worried about privacy, Maria tries the AI Personal Knowledge Manager.

After a quick sign-up, Maria uploads her notes, slides, and research articles. The AI instantly categorizes and tags her materials, making them easy to browse. When she needs to recall a key concept, she simply types a question into the search bar—or uses voice search during a study session. The system surfaces the exact note she needs, complete with context and tags.

Maria feels in control of her knowledge for the first time. Her data is encrypted and private, and she spends less time searching and more time learning. The product not only streamlines her workflow but also builds trust, setting the stage for long-term engagement and word-of-mouth growth.
